			Experimental project to build a <strong>totally customized calendar</strong> that shows the employees&#39; timetables and their respective tasks.</p>
		<p>
			The tasks can be moved by <strong>drag&#39;n&#39;drop </strong>and created from a &quot;tasks&quot; toolbar, also by drag&#39;n&#39;drop.</p>
		<p>
			(The expected behaviour is similar as with Google Calendar)</p>
		<p>
			Note: This project is an evolution of the other one titled &#39;z_gwt_gae&#39;</p>
